    "In principle, one can define an arbitrary spin cluster by manually specifying positions of the cluster sites, interactions that are treated exactly and interaction that are to be mean-field approximated. For spin clusters with periodic boundary conditions that are multiples of the unit cell of conventional lattice spin model, however, we have automated this. We illustrate how to use the package for this usecase by showing the example of the $J_1-J_2$ Heisenberg model on the square lattice. We first provide the code and then explain what happens in detail below."

It also determines the interactions that would occur between sites of different clusters (which will be mean-field approximated), and maps the sites back to sites within the cluster applying periodic boundary conditions.

The n-th basis state $|n\\rangle = |s_1 s_2 s_3, \\dots, s_N \\rangle$ is then defined by the binary represenation $n = \\sum_{i = 1}^N 2^{i-1} s_i$. \n",

The matrix-representation of the spin-operators on each site and in each components for a cluster of site N can be obtained by  ```calculate_spinoperators(N)```. From these, the matrix representation of most operators can be calculated (although this may be costly for large clusters)."
